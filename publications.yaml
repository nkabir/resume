  abstract: >
    Many classic protocols in the fault tolerant distributed computing
    literature assume a Crash-Fail model in which processes either are up, or
    have crashed and are permanently down. While this model is useful, it does
    not fully capture the difficulties many real systems must contend with. In
    particular, real-world systems are long-lived and must have a recovery
    mechanism so that crashed processes can rejoin the system and restore its
    fault-tolerance. When processes are assumed to have access to stable storage
    that is persistent across failures, the Crash-Recovery model is trivial.
    However, because disk failures are common and because having a disk on a
    protocol's critical path is often performance concern, diskless recovery
    protocols are needed. While such protocols do exist in the state machine
    replication literature, several well-known protocols have flawed recovery
    mechanisms. We examine these errors to elucidate the problem of diskless
    recovery and present our own protocol for providing virtual stable storage,
    transforming any protocol in the Crash-Recovery with stable storage model
    into a protocol in the Diskless Crash-Recover model.


- title: Scaling Leader-Based Protocols for State Machine Replication

    State machine replication is a technique used to guarantee the availability
    of a system even in the presence of faults. Agreement protocols are often
    used to implement state machine replication. However, the throughput of many
    agreement protocols, such as Paxos, does not scale with the number of
    machines available to the system. Systems whose throughput does scale often
    provide weaker consistency guarantees than state machine replication's
    linearizability. These weaker guarantees, such as eventual consistency, make
    the job of the application programmer much more difficult.

    Kapritsos and Junqueira previously proposed a protocol which uses an
    agreement protocol as a primitive and does scale. In this thesis, I describe
    my novel implementation of this protocol as well as the optimizations that
    were necessary to achieve scalability. The results of my experiments with
    this system show modest but promising evidence that the throughput of this
    system can, indeed, scale linearly with the number of machines.
